      "1. **Data Mining**. Don't let the name scare you! If you have already heard other buzzwords such as *big data*, *data science*, and their derivatives mentioned in the media, chances that you already have a clue about data mining are high. Data mining is about *explaining the past* and *predicting the future* by means of data analysis. It combines statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and database technology. Unfortunately we won't have time enough to cover all those topics.\n",
      "2. **Text Analysis**. Whenever you need to identify the most relevant actor in a play, analyze a corpus to extract the main entities, or process natural language to atribute authorship of an anonymous book, you will make use of text analysis techniques. Text analysis can be seen as the means to produce valuable information (i.e., data to be analyzed) from text sources.\n",
      "3. **Networks Science**. Facebook, twitter, tumblr, instagram, etc. are all examples of social networks. But networks can be built by interconnecting any kind of entity, not only people. That's how Social Network Analysis (SNA) is based on the more general Graph Theory. Network Science tries to understand complex structures by analyzing the relationships among their entities.\n",
