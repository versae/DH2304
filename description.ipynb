      "We find computers and software in almost any field of study, from STEM disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics), to Education and Arts. In the Humanities, for example, there is even a whole sub-discipline (or a discipline by itself, depending on who you ask) that tries to find answers to new and old questions by digital means. This approach, referred to as Digital Humanities, usually borrows methods from the sciences to analyze their own data, and produce interpretations and conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data is today the new currency: is easy to produce and easy to collect; although the analysis still remains as one of the most complex steps in the workflow of any analytical proccess. This tendency of focusing solely into the data as the Holy Grail that solves everything, yet arguable, is producing important advances in the theoretical framework of the Data Science. Which is later translated into methods and tools with the enough madurity to be extrapolated and used in other fields. One of those is the Digital Humanities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being able to manipulate, manage and get value out of data is not only an in demand skill for researchers, but also a future-proof recipe for digital humanists in a field that is getting familiar with fast-paced introduction of innovative products to manage data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, in the Humanities, data may come in a variety of formats: from mere CSV files or tables, to books, blog posts, tweets, or even network data from social or literary networks. Obviously, critical thinking and content related courses are completely necessary, but if we do not teach courses on new tools and methods, our next generation of students will graduate with limited knowledge of what can be done and how. It is not only about tools, software or applications, but, rather, it is to give students the skills they need to adapt to the changing environment of research. We do not know if Python will be widely used in 5 or 10 years, but we have to prepare our students to go beyond the next trend and apply their knowledge to the newest and coolest tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "This course is focused in three main areas that I have surmised as the most important: data mining, text analysis, and network science. The election is not casual, is based on two principles:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Most common topics in conferences such as Digital Humanities (the biggest world conference in the field), Canadian Society of Digital Humanities, or the Summer Institute Innitiative.\n",

      "I have a strong background in Computer Sciences. When I first enrolled in Computer Engineering I was very disappointed because I did not see a computer until three months into my program. All my colleagues felt the same way. And when we finally were in front of a computer, we were limited to only what the teacher wanted us to do. My first years in college were so frustrating for a guy who wanted to be roboticist, with only studying mathematics, physics and more mathematics. After finishing my Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees, I decided that, if I ever had the chance to teach a computer science related course, that would be intended as a learning by doing course.\n",
      "\n",
      "After several years, I understood the point of acquiring all the mathematical knowledge they had taught us, but even so, I found that it is not the best way to teach computer sciences. People need participate and experience through trial and error. For this reason I believe the teacher must play the role of a \"facilitator\" of learning, and not the role of the \"expert\" that only gives information in one direction. I am sure that teaching is an amazing and practical way of learning for teachers, and, therefore, there must be a proper environment in the class for students to freely share and express their ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I believe that one successful way to reach students is by \u201cspeaking\u201d their own language. Keeping myself up to date with all the trends and technologies they usually use, may mean students feel more comfortable and confident in class. On the other hand, making the content more appealing, as well as challenging is a plus, so as to catch the interest and attention of the students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive attitude is a must have for a teacher, and passion for what she or he teaches is very important as well. The process of teaching, interestingly, is in itself an amazing method of learning for an educator. For that reason, there must be an appropriate educational environment for students to freely share and express their ideas. The teacher is there to encourage the procurement of knowledge for the student, but they are also responsible for the instruction that comes from these exchanges. Daily small activities are intended to achieve this, promoting pair or group work whenever possible."

One solution is to make use of a **lexicon**, which describes how different words relate to one another.
